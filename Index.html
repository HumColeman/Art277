   <p>We’ve heard it all since the pandemic started — lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don’t work, 
    <br>  if you already had COVID-19 you can’t get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your DNA or put a tracking device in your body.</p>

<p>It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation.
    <br> But despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. </p>
 <p> Wonderful news, right?</p> 
 <p>Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or they’re going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. 
    <br> And despite the extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else. </p>
 <br> So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href=""> Lyssette Cardona,</a> MD,
<br> answers those questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.
