            "Fully vaccinated" doesn't mean "immune to COVID-19"

        </h1
        <p>
            As restoration and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be <br>
            feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn't the time to let your guard<br>
            down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become infected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cardona exp;ains.
        </p>
        <p>

            "Fully vacinated" means that you have completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best <br>
            protection against severe complication s such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness,
             yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” 
            </p>  
            <h1>

                Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?
            </h1>  
           <p>

            While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also
             be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.  
           </p>  
           <p>
            “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.
             We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
